# OctoScript
Compiling:
    `make all`
Executing:
    `./toplevel.native`
Running Test Scripts:
    `./testrunner.py negative_tests/* positive_tests/*`
    The positive test files are present in the positive_tests directory.
    The negative test files are present in the negative_tests directory.

Syntax needed to be added:
    The lambda functions needs to be added to the ast.ml after we get our basic functionality and the Table type running.

Current known issues:
    String literals fail parsing
    List/Tuple literals fail parsing
    Variable declarations fail parsing, add additional declaration form in ast
