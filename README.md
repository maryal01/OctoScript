# OctoScript
Compiling:
    `make all`

Executing:
    `./toplevel.native`

Cleaning:
    `make clean`

Running Test Script:
    `./testall.sh`
    
Validation of the Test :
   The program compiles and runs appropriately if every test name followed by "OK" is printed to the stdout.


Description of tests:
    * test-assign tests variable declaration and assignment
    * test-if-1 tests that all branches of if statement are properly reached and that they can be nested
    * test-if-2 tests that the dangling else problem is handled correctly
    * test-ifexpr tests that if expressions (which return values) work correclty
    * test-list tests that lists can be properly created, passed to functions, and printed out
    * test-print tests that printing works correctly for all primitive types
    * test-while tests that while loops work correctly
    * fail-assign-1 tests that a variable declared as one type cannot then be assigned to another in a different statement
    * fail-assign-2 tests that a variable declared as one type cannot then be assigned to another in the same statement
    * fail-binop tests that the operands to a binary expression must be of the same type
    * fail-function-1 tests that what is returned by a funciton must be of the same type as the given return type
    * fail-function-2 tests that parameters must be called with the correct type and number of parameters
    * fail-function-3 tests that only previously defined functions can be called
    * fail-ifexpr tests that both branches of an if expression (which returns a value) must return values of the same type
    * fail-list tests that list contents must be of the same type
    * fail-return tests that returns can only be inside of functions
    * fail-unop tests that unary operators can only be called on values of the proper types
